What Are We Having?

Objective:

We want to build a website that users will be able to utilize when they can not 
figure out what they want to eat.

Experience:

We want the user to be able to easily pick their preference on vegetarian, vegan, or no preference.
We want the user to be able to pick between Alcohol or Non Alcoholic drinks.
The user should use this website when at home, because they will want to prepare the food at home.
This will make for a great date and will save you $.

Motivation:

Have you or your partner ever have problems figuring out what you want to eat?
Have to fear our website is here!
What Are We Having will help you decide what food/drink you can try and save. The user will be able to go back to in the future.

Process:


We used multiple server-side APIs
We used spoonacular and thecocktaildb APIs to generate what the user will use.
We used Bulma.io as our CSS framework.


Directions:

We want to continue to add options for food/drink preferences.(carnivore diet, keto diet ect.)
We want to continue to polish the UI and create a better user experience.
